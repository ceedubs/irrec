## performance

Irrec's main strengths are its strongly-typed API, composability, and its ability to generate random regular expressions and matches for regular expressions. While performance is certainly considered, it takes a backseat to the features that distinguish irrec from other regular expression implementations.

Irrec has recently been rewritten, and it hasn't yet been properly optimized and benchmarked after the rewrite. Once (if?) this happens, the results will be posted here.
